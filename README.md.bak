# MCP-.Net-8-Claude-CLI

this is my attempt to build an independent .Net 8 dev env detached from my computer except local folder for whatever like source or DB.

## TODO 
* add reamde about the Dockerfile
* add reamde about the yaml file



## Instuctions:

IN LOCAL FOLDER:

### build (~5 min)

* `docker-compose build` 	=> ONCE build the image
* `docker-compose up -d` 	=> run it
* `docker-compose ps` 		=> test it runs
* `docker-compose down`		=> shut down


### re-build

* `docker-compose logs` 					=> see why something was not working
* `docker-compose down -v` 					=> remove everything
* `docker rmi mcp-codernet8claude:v1.0` 	=> DELETE everything
* `docker-compose build --no-cache` 		=> rebuild without any cashing
